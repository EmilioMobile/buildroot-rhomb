Rhomb specific instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) Run below command
   # sudo ./build.sh all
   This command will take little long for the first time run as it downloads
   all the packages and then compile. It will generated zImage (dtb appended )
   and rootfs.tar in "<buidroot_rhomb>/output/images/".

2) To rebuild linux kernel.
   # sudo ./build.sh linux
   This command rebuild linux kernel with latest chagnes and install kernel
   image (zImage with dtb appended) in "<buidroot_rhomb>/output/images/".

3) To rebuild u-boot 
   # sudo ./build.sh uboot
   This command rebuild uboot with latest chagnes and install uboot image 
    in "<buidroot_rhomb>/output/images/".

4) To build rootfs.tar
   # sudo ./build.sh rootfs

5) To get help of the 'build.sh' script
   # sudo ./build.sh help

6) There is one more script 'prepare_sd.sh'. Using this script user can flash
   geneated 'zImage' and 'rootfs.tar' in sd card.
   run 'prepare_sd.sh' script:
   # sudo ./prepare_sd.sh <SD Reader's device file>
   example <SD Reader's device file> : sdb, mmcblk0, sdd, sdc etc
   Once SD card is prepared user need to set board for SD bootmode.
   Insert prepared SD card and power on board.
   Now onwards setting bootargs and bootcmd are taken care in u-boot itself.

7) For EMMC flashing user need to first follow steps 1-6. Once board is booted
   from SD card user need to login. "buildroot login: " prompt by entering
   "root".
8) After that apply below commands.
   # cd /opt/
   # tar -xf images.tar
   # ./emmc_fusing.sh mmcblk1
        (This script will ask user if "/dev/mmcblk1p1" already formated with ext4
        filesystem as below)

        /dev/mmcblk1p1 contains a ext4 file system
                last mounted on / on Thu Jan  1 00:00:02 1970
        Proceed anyway? (y,N)
        Enter 'y' if it asked first time.
        For next time onwards user can enter 'N'
9) At the end of above command below messages will be printed
        eMMC flashed
        Power off the board
        Set emmc boot mode boot board
        Good luck!
10) User need to set board in EMMC bootmode to boot board from EMMC.
11) Once user set board in EMMC bootmode and power on board board will boot from
    EMMC. Here setting bootcmd, bootargs are taken by "emmc_fusing.sh" script.

Generic instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on Freenode IRC.
